# CMPT395-Assignment1-TDD-Framework

For this assignment, I used the “TDD Manifesto” website (https://tddmanifesto.com/) to deepen the fundamentals of TDD.
In the “Exercise” section, I selected two different katas, katas 1 and 5 that I implemented to practice.
The assignment is commented within the code for better understanding on how the program works.

# Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

* src: the folder to maintain sources
* lib: the folder to maintain dependencies
* Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the bin folder by default.

If you want to customize the folder structure, open .vscode/settings.json and update the related settings there.

# Dependency Management
The JAVA PROJECTS view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found here.
